## Why use BLOC?
BLOC has been designed to address the challenges of creating and managing educational content, such as:

- **Serving the same content in different formats (*e.g., web pages, eBooks, PDFs*)**: BLOC's XML foundation allows for easy transformation and styling, providing a single source for diverse outputs.
- **Reusing content across different courses or materials**: BLOC's modular structure makes it easy to repurpose lessons, sections, or individual content elements.
- **Storing interactive content (*e.g., quizzes, assessments*)**: BLOC contains tags for embedding interactive content.
